            <br /> Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
            Bratskih narodov soyuz vekovoi,
            Predkami dannaya mudrost' narodnaya!
            Slav'sya, strana! My gordimsya toboi!
            Ot yuzhnyh morei do polyarnogo kraya
            Raskinulis' nashi lesa i polya.
            Odna ty na svete! Odna ty takaya –
            Khranimaya Bogom rodnaya zemlya!
            Shirokii prostor dlya mechty i dlya zhizni.
            Gryadushchiye nam otkryvayut goda.
            Nam silu daiot nasha vernost' Otchizne.
            Tak bylo, tak yest' i tak budet vsegda!<br />

            <h3>National Anthem of the United States </h3>
            O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
            What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
            Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
            O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
            And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
            Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
            O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
            O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br />

            <h3>Natinal anthem of the UK</h3>
            God Save the Queen
            God save our gracious Queen,
            Long live our noble Queen,
            God save the Queen;
            Send her victorious,
            Happy and glorious,
            Long to reign over us,
            God save the Queen.
            Oh Lord our God arise,
            Scatter our enemies,
            And make them fall
            Confound their politics
            Frustrate their knavish tricks,
            On Thee our hopes we fix
            Oh, save us all.
            Thy choicest gifts in store
            On her be pleased to pour;
            Long may she reign;
            May she defend our laws
            And ever give us cause
            To sing with heart and voice
            God save the Queen.
            Our loved Dominion bless
            With peace and happiness
            From shore to shore;
            And let our Empire be
            United, loyal, free,
            True to herself and Thee
            Forevermore.
