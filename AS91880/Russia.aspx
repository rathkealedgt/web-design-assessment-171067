           Who lead the Revolution in 1917 creating the Soviet Union which was only to be for about 90 years. The most Communist of them all his leadership was great and glorious. 
            <h4>Rateing</h4>
            5/10 
            I would have given him a higher rating but he is a communist so his score is lowered. And also the fact that communism failed in the end. But his Inspiring leadership helped Russia Become what it is today.
